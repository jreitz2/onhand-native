This is a complete rework of the On-hand Cuisine web app as an android mobile app created with React Native. The user can search for recipes by ingredients that they already have on hand. Items in the list of results can be pressed, loading detailed information such as ingredient list, instructions, and nutritional information. The search query is filterable by several parameters. The user can also save recipes to their list of favorites, or share recipes with others.
